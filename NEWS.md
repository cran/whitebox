# whitebox 2.1.4

 * Suggest {terra} instead of {raster} and update demo vignette accordingly; drops {rgdal} suggest

 * Add support for path expansion in `wd` arguments passed directly to tool functions; this was already supported for other methods of setting the working directory
 
 * Updates to `wbttools` and `wbttoolparameters` datasets
 
    * Fix for `argument_name='k'`
    
    * Remove several one and two character flag aliases from `argument_name` and replace with full name
    
 * Add support for showing warning messages in regular interactive/verbose mode, thanks to @alenahav for reporting an issue (https://github.com/giswqs/whiteboxR/issues/75) with `wbt_fd8_flow_accumulation()`
 
 * Functions that take multiple files are auto-quoted by default; thanks to Fran√ßois-Nicolas Robinne for reporting issue (@FNRobinne; https://github.com/giswqs/whiteboxR/issues/55) with `wbt_mosaic()`
 
 * Error output is now more verbose, ensuring relevant tool output is displayed to user on error regardless of verbosity, platform, etc. Thanks to Jeffrey W. Rozelle for reporting issue (@jwilliamrozelle; https://github.com/giswqs/whiteboxR/issues/80) with getting error messages about unsupported raster types
 

# whitebox 2.1.3

 * Generated `whitebox_tools` commands no longer include flags for default arguments that are stored in settings.json unless specified by the user.
 
   * Updates to fix issues with permissions to write _settings.json_; thanks to Henrik (@hewag1975) for reporting problems on Shiny Server (https://github.com/giswqs/whiteboxR/issues/67)
 
 * `wbt_install()` / `install_whitebox()` now removes the downloaded zip file on exit thanks to Christoph Stepper (@cstepper; https://github.com/giswqs/whiteboxR/issues/72)
 
 * New default arguments for `wbt_list_tools()`, `wbt_time_in_daylight()`, `wbt_shadow_image()` thanks to Jens Wiesehahn (@wiesehahn; https://github.com/giswqs/whiteboxR/issues/70, https://github.com/giswqs/whiteboxR/issues/73)
 
# whitebox 2.1.2

 * Fixes regression in checking "Demo" vignette on CRAN
 
# whitebox 2.1.1

 * File path arguments to tools now automatically perform path expansion (converting `~` to your home directory with `path.expand()`). This also works on arguments that contain comma or semicolon delimited lists. (https://github.com/giswqs/whiteboxR/issues/62)
 
 * Corrections to `wbttoolparameters` dataset (updated classification of input/output parameters) 
 
 * Fix for `wbt_lidar_tin_gridding()` `exclude_cls` argument
 
 * Add `wbt_compress_rasters()` to set package option `whitebox.compress_rasters`
 
   * Updated how `--compress_rasters` parameter is passed via command line. Now the flag is added to all commands regardless of whether the value is `TRUE` or `FALSE`. This allows update of settings.json accordingly when `--compress_rasters=FALSE`. RE: https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox-tools/issues/233#issuecomment-1065955783
   
 * Add `wbt_max_procs()` to set package option `whitebox.max_procs`
 
 * All `wbt_*()` tool functions now take a `command_only` argument that is passed to `wbt_run_tool()`. When `TRUE`, the function returns the command that would be run by `system()` instead of running the tool.

# whitebox 2.1.0

 * Update for WhiteboxTools v2.1.0  
 
   - See https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/whitebox-geospatial-news/ for details

# whitebox 2.0.0

 * Update for WhiteboxTools v2.0.0  
  
   - See https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox-tools/releases/tag/v2.0.0 for details

Enhancements:
 
 - `whitebox::install_whitebox()` will call `wbt_init()` on the `exe_path` after unpacking to target directory  
 
 - `wbt_init()` `exe_path`, `wbt_wd()` `wd`, and `install_whitebox()` `pkg_dir` paths can be specified with shorthand `~` for home directory, which is expanded with `path.expand()`
 
 - Unsetting working directories requires only a single call to `wbt_wd("")`
 
 - Functions no longer use `match.call()` so unconventional/automated methods for calling tools that do not have a parsable tool name in the call result now work (#45)

# whitebox 1.5.1
 
 * Add package options for custom EXE path and verbosity
 
   * Changes behavior of `wbt_init()`; now only checks EXE path
 
  * Adds `install_whitebox()` to handle downloading and installing WhiteboxTools
  
## New package options 
 
  * `wbt_init()` can set any of the other options in the same call as the custom EXE path. 
 
    * `wbt_options()` returns current option values
 
  * Use a system environment variable (`R_WHITEBOX_EXE_PATH`) or package option (`whitebox.exe_path`) 
 
    * Get / set with `wbt_init()`. 
 
  * Verbosity controlled with (`R_WHITEBOX_VERBOSE`) or package option (`whitebox.verbose`) 
 
    * Get / set with `wbt_verbose()`
 
  * Working directory controlled with (`R_WHITEBOX_WD`) or package option (`whitebox.wd`) 
 
    * Get / set with `wbt_wd()`
        
  * New "whitebox Demo" vignette

  * New data `wbttools` and `wbttoolparameters` data.frame built from WhiteboxTools v1.5.0 and `wbt_tool_parameters()` output for full tool library

    * See the "whitebox Tool Metadata" vignette
